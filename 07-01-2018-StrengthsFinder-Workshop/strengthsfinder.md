# Strength Finder

I have skills that were identified by the gallop poll I took and
learned some stuff.

## My strength skills #top5

Here they are:

 1. Restorative: Adept at dealing with problems. Good at figuring out
what is wrong and resolving it.
    + Executing
 2. Adaptability: Prefer to "go with the flow." Tend to be "no" people
who take things as they come and discover the future one day at a time.
    + Relationship Building
 3. Strategic: Create alternative ways to proceed. Can quickly spot the
relevant patterns and issues.
    + Strategic Thinking
 4. Learner: Have great desire to learn and want to improve. The process
of learning is what excites them.
    + Strategic Thinking
 5. Arranger: Can organize, but also have a flexibility that compliments
that ability. Like to figure out how all of the pieces and resources
can be arranged for maximum productivity.
    + Executing

I am missing from the Influencing thing over all

## Story that showcases these

I have always enjoyed memeing and I believe this may encompass most of
my strengths, but more specifically exemplify the adaptability and
learner traits. I always enjoyed making new memes and figuring out 
what has worked and what has not.


## Things that I am interested in

I wanted to have the futurist strength, but would that kind of conflict
with adaptability(?)

^ my godly epic friend Samarth got those. 'Restorative' make me look like a stupid healer.
